One of the most impressive features of Xpand2 is its extensive sound library, which contains over 2500 patches ranging from realistic acoustic instruments to futuristic synth sounds. You can easily find the sound you need by browsing through the categories, such as Bass, Brass, Drums, Keys, Pads, Strings, and more. You can also use the search function to type in keywords and filter the results by category, timbre, or character. Each patch can be customized with the six smart knobs, which control different parameters depending on the part selected. For example, you can adjust the filter cutoff, resonance, envelope, and LFO for a synth part, or the reverb, chorus, delay, and EQ for a piano part.

Another powerful feature of Xpand2 is its advanced arpeggiation system, which allows you to create rhythmic and melodic patterns with ease. Each part has its own arpeggiator, which can be set to different modes, such as Up, Down, Random, Chord, or Phrase. You can also adjust the rate, gate, swing, octave range, and latch settings to fine-tune your arpeggios. Some patches, such as Action Pads and Loops, have the arpeggiator enabled by default, as it forms an integral part of the sound. You can also use the arpeggiator to trigger external MIDI devices or other plugins in your Pro Tools session.

Xpand2 also allows you to layer up to four sounds in a single patch, creating rich and complex textures. You can use the Mix knob to adjust the volume of each part, or use the Solo and Mute buttons to isolate or silence them. You can also use the Note Range (Zone) settings to assign different parts to different regions of the keyboard, creating splits and layers. For example, you can have a bass sound on the lower octaves, a piano sound on the middle octaves, and a string sound on the upper octaves. You can also use the Voice Mode settings to choose between polyphonic or monophonic modes for each part, and set the priority for monophonic parts to First, Last, Highest, or Lowest.
 
If you want to create your own patches from scratch, Xpand2 gives you plenty of options to do so. You can start by choosing one of the four sound sources for each part: Sample Playback, Synth (Wavetable), Synth (FM), or Synth (Tone Wheel). Each sound source has its own set of parameters that you can tweak with the Edit button. For example, you can adjust the pitch, filter, envelope, modulation, and effects for a sample playback part, or change the waveform, harmonics, modulation matrix, and effects for a synth part. You can also use the Copy and Paste buttons to duplicate parts or transfer settings between them. Once you are happy with your patch, you can save it by clicking on the Save button and giving it a name and a category.
