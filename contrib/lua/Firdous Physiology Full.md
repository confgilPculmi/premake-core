Firdous physiology Full is a book that covers all aspects of human physiology, from the cellular level to the organ systems. It is written by Dr. Firdous Ahmad, a renowned professor of physiology and medicine at the University of Kashmir. The book is designed for students, teachers, researchers, and practitioners who want to learn more about how the human body works and adapts to various conditions.
 
The book consists of 16 chapters, each focusing on a different system or topic of physiology. The chapters are organized in a logical sequence, starting with the basic principles of physiology and ending with the integration of body functions. Each chapter includes clear explanations, diagrams, tables, graphs, clinical cases, and review questions. The book also features online resources such as videos, animations, quizzes, and interactive exercises.

Firdous physiology Full is a comprehensive and updated guide to human physiology that reflects the latest research and developments in the field. It is suitable for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses in physiology and related disciplines. It is also a valuable reference for anyone who wants to understand the mechanisms and processes that underlie human health and disease.
  
## Chapter 1: Introduction to Physiology
 
Physiology is the study of how living organisms function and interact with their environment. It is a branch of biology that deals with the physical and chemical processes that occur in cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. Physiology also examines how these processes are regulated and coordinated to maintain homeostasis, which is the state of dynamic equilibrium in the body.

Physiology is a multidisciplinary science that draws from various fields such as anatomy, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, pharmacology, pathology, and immunology. It also applies the principles of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering to explain the phenomena of life. Physiology is closely related to medicine and clinical practice, as it provides the basis for understanding the normal and abnormal functions of the human body.
 
Physiology can be divided into several subdisciplines based on the level of organization or the system of interest. Some examples are cellular physiology, which studies the functions of individual cells; systemic physiology, which studies the functions of specific organ systems such as the cardiovascular system or the nervous system; and comparative physiology, which studies the similarities and differences in physiological functions among different species.
  
## Chapter 2: The Cell: Basic Unit of Life
 
The cell is the basic unit of life and the smallest entity that can perform all the functions of living organisms. All cells share some common features, such as a plasma membrane that separates them from the external environment, a cytoplasm that contains various organelles and molecules, and a nucleus that stores the genetic information. However, cells also differ in their structure and function depending on their type and location in the body.
 
There are two major types of cells in the human body: somatic cells and germ cells. Somatic cells are the cells that form the tissues and organs of the body, such as skin cells, muscle cells, nerve cells, and blood cells. Germ cells are the cells that produce gametes (sperm and egg cells) for sexual reproduction. Somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in their nuclei, while germ cells have 23 chromosomes (one from each pair) in their nuclei.
 
Cells communicate with each other and with their environment through various mechanisms, such as chemical signals (hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines), electrical signals (action potentials), mechanical signals (pressure, stretch), and cell-to-cell contact (gap junctions, synapses). These signals can affect the activity and behavior of the target cells by altering their gene expression, metabolism, membrane potential, or shape.
  
## Chapter 3: Membrane Physiology
 
The plasma membrane is a thin layer of phospholipids and proteins that surrounds every cell and separates it from the extracellular fluid. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable, meaning that it allows some substances to pass through while blocking others. The plasma membrane also serves as a site for cell recognition, adhesion, signaling, and transport.
 
The plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, which have a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-hating) tail. The hydrophilic heads face the aqueous environments inside and outside the cell, while the hydrophobic tails face each other in the middle of the bilayer. The phospholipids can move laterally within the bilayer, but they rarely flip-flop across it. This gives the plasma membrane a fluid-like property.
 
The plasma membrane also contains various proteins that perform specific functions. Some proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer (integral proteins), while others are attached to either surface of the bilayer (peripheral proteins). Some proteins act as channels or carriers that facilitate the movement of substances across the membrane. Some proteins act as receptors that bind to specific molecules and trigger a response in the cell. Some proteins act as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions on or near the membrane. Some proteins act as anchors that link the membrane to other structures such as the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix.
