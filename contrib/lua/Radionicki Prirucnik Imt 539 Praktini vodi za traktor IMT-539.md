The IMT-539 tractor was one of the most popular models produced by IMT, along with the IMT-533 tractor that had 33 hp (25 kW) of power. These tractors became popular in Yugoslavia and other countries because they were reliable, easy to handle, manoeuvrable and capable. Their popularity resulted in the advancement of mechanisation and modernisation in rural areas. The IMT-539 tractor was also exported to England and sold as the Marshall 132.[^2^] In 1988, IMT recorded its largest annual production in history - 42,000 tractors and 35,000 machines.[^3^]
 
However, after the breakup of Yugoslavia and the economic crisis that followed, IMT faced many difficulties and challenges that affected its production and sales. In 2015, the company ceased production and went into bankruptcy procedure, with 186 million dollars of accumulated debt.[^4^] In 2018, the company was sold to the Indian manufacturing company TAFE , which plans to revive the brand and continue producing tractors and machinery for domestic and international markets.[^4^]
