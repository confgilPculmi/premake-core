Sorokin argues that social mobility is a universal phenomenon that occurs in all societies and historical periods. He distinguishes between horizontal mobility, which involves changing one's location or occupation without changing one's social status, and vertical mobility, which involves rising or falling in the social hierarchy. He identifies various factors that influence vertical mobility, such as heredity, environment, selection, adaptation, education, economic conditions, political power, and cultural values.
 
Sorokin also explores the consequences of mobility for individuals and societies. He suggests that mobility can have positive effects, such as increasing social diversity, stimulating innovation, and promoting social justice. However, he also warns that mobility can have negative effects, such as creating social instability, weakening social ties, and generating psychological stress. He proposes that the optimal level of mobility is one that balances stability and change, continuity and innovation, solidarity and individualism.
 
Social and Cultural Mobility is a comprehensive and insightful study of one of the most important aspects of social life. It is based on extensive empirical data and theoretical analysis. It is also written in a clear and engaging style that makes it accessible to a wide audience. The book is available for free download from various online sources[^1^] [^2^].
