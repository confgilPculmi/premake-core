Drivers are essential for the proper functioning of your PC and its peripherals. They enable the communication between your hardware and software, ensuring that everything works smoothly and securely. However, drivers can become outdated or corrupted over time, causing various problems such as poor performance, errors, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities.
 
That's why it's important to keep your drivers updated regularly, but doing so manually can be a hassle and a risk. You have to search for the right drivers for your specific device model and operating system, download them from reliable sources, and install them correctly. If you make a mistake or download a wrong or malicious driver, you might end up with more issues than before.
