The film's plot revolves around two crew members of the Elysium, Corporal Bower and Lieutenant Payton, who wake up from hypersleep with partial amnesia and possibly suffering from pandorum, a mental disorder that causes paranoia and delirium. They find out that they are locked in a room and unable to access the bridge. They also discover that the ship is experiencing power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor that needs to be restarted. Bower decides to crawl through the ventilation system to reach the reactor, while Payton stays behind to guide him via radio transmitter.
 
Along the way, Bower encounters various dangers and mysteries. He finds a dead body and a wounded mechanic who warns him to escape "them". He soon realizes that "they" are a group of cannibalistic humanoids who have evolved from some of the passengers due to genetic mutation and natural selection. They are sensitive to light and sound, and hunt down any survivors they can find. Bower also meets an environmental scientist named Nadia and a farmer named Manh, who join him in his quest. They stumble upon a cook named Leland, who has been awake for years and has resorted to cannibalism himself. He tells them that the ship has been flying for 923 years, much longer than planned, and that they have already arrived at Tanis. He also reveals that there were three flight teams before them, and that one of them suffered from pandorum and killed most of the crew.

Meanwhile, Payton rescues another crew member named Gallo, who claims to be from Flight Team 1. Gallo tells him that he was part of the team that received the transmission from Earth, which announced its destruction by nuclear war. He says that he and his team decided to open all the hypersleep pods and let everyone live their lives on the ship. However, he admits that he killed his captain after he developed pandorum and tried to kill him. He also says that he suffers from pandorum himself, but he has learned to control it.
 
Bower, Nadia, and Manh reach the reactor and manage to restart it. However, they also trigger a self-destruct sequence that will destroy the ship in 15 minutes. They try to escape to the bridge, but they are attacked by more humanoids. Bower fights them off while Nadia and Manh reach an elevator that leads to the bridge. Bower follows them but gets separated by a closing door. He contacts Payton and tells him to stop the self-destruct sequence.
 
Payton then realizes that Gallo is actually his split personality, caused by pandorum. He remembers that he is actually the captain of Flight Team 5, and that he killed his co-pilot after he tried to kill him. He also remembers that he locked himself in the room with Bower's pod and pretended to be his lieutenant. He decides to embrace his pandorum and let the ship explode.
 
Bower reaches another elevator and finds Leland inside. Leland tries to kill him but Bower kills him instead. He then contacts Nadia and Manh, who have reached the bridge and found out that it is flooded with water. They also see a window that shows them that they are underwater on Tanis. They realize that the ship landed on the planet long ago, but no one noticed because of the power failure and the pandorum.
 
Bower tells them that Payton has gone mad and will not stop the self-destruct sequence. He tells them to eject the bridge pod, which is actually an escape pod, before it is too late. Nadia and Manh do so, and they are launched into the ocean. Bower stays behind on the ship, hoping to save more survivors.
 
The film ends with Nadia and Manh emerging from their pod on the surface of Tanis. They see a blue sky with two suns and a lush landscape with mountains and forests. They also see thousands of other pods floating on the water, implying that there are many more survivors on the planet.
