The film begins with Uday (Pulkit Jawahar), a young photojournalist, who is on an assignment in the Sundarbans. He comes across a white tiger cub trapped in a poacher's net and frees it. He takes the cub to his cottage and names it Kala. However, this angers the villagers, who believe that the white tiger is the protector of the forest and its cub should not be taken away. The forest warden (Achint Kaur) arrives and confiscates the cub, warning Uday that he has disturbed the balance of nature and provoked the wrath of the white tigress.

Meanwhile, Uday's brother Pundit (Abhinav Shukla), a commando trainer, receives a call from Uday's girlfriend Jhumpa (Himarsha Venkatsamy), who informs him that Uday has gone missing in the forest. Pundit gathers his team of commandos, including Kashmiri (Aadil Chahal), Sufi (Aaran Chaudhary), Madhu (Pranay Dixit), Bheera (Subrat Dutta), CJ (Nora Fatehi) and Hero (Ali Quli Mirza), and heads to the Sundarbans to find Uday. They learn from the forest warden that Uday was attacked and killed by the white tigress, who was looking for her cub. The warden also tells them that the core area of the forest is off-limits to humans and they should not venture there.
  
However, Pundit and his team decide to ignore the warning and enter the core area to hunt down the white tigress and avenge Uday's death. They face many dangers and challenges in the forest, such as crocodiles, snakes, quicksand and tribal people. They also realize that the white tigress is not an ordinary animal, but a cunning and ruthless predator who can sense their every move. The tigress kills most of the commandos one by one, leaving only Pundit, Jhumpa and Bheera alive. They manage to locate Kala, who has grown into a young tiger, and use him as bait to lure the tigress. In a final confrontation, Pundit shoots the tigress with a tranquilizer gun and sets her on fire. However, he is shocked to see that the tigress is still alive and attacks him. He then realizes that he has made a grave mistake by killing an innocent creature and asks for forgiveness. The tigress spares his life and leaves with Kala. Pundit, Jhumpa and Bheera return to civilization with a new respect for nature and its balance.
