# What is VCR X86 X64 13102011 20 and how to download it?
 
VCR X86 X64 13102011 20 is a file name that refers to a compressed archive containing Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2010. These packages install runtime components of C Runtime (CRT), Standard C++, ATL, MFC, OpenMP and MSDIA libraries. They are required for running applications developed with Visual Studio 2010 on a computer that does not have Visual Studio 2010 installed[^1^] [^2^].

Visual Studio 2010 also offers many features that can enhance your productivity and creativity as a developer. Here are some of them:

1. **Multi-monitor support**: You can now drag and drop documents and tool windows to different monitors and arrange them as you like. This can help you view more code and design elements at the same time and reduce switching between windows. You can also customize the layout of each monitor by using the Window menu or keyboard shortcuts. [^2^]
2. **IntelliSense improvements**: IntelliSense is a feature that provides code completion, parameter information, quick info, and member lists as you type. Visual Studio 2010 has improved IntelliSense in several ways, such as:
    - Suggestion mode: You can switch between completion mode and suggestion mode by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Spacebar. In suggestion mode, IntelliSense does not automatically complete your code, but rather suggests possible matches that you can select or ignore. This can be useful when you want to type a new identifier or use a different casing than the existing one.
    - Filtering and highlighting: You can filter the IntelliSense list by typing characters that appear in the member name, return type, or parameter type. The matching items will be highlighted and moved to the top of the list. You can also use camel case or Pascal case abbreviations to filter the list.
    - Call Hierarchy: You can right-click a method or property name and select Call Hierarchy to see a tree view of its callers and callees. You can also navigate to the source code of any node in the tree.
3. **Improved support for Silverlight**: Silverlight is a cross-platform framework for creating rich internet applications. Visual Studio 2010 provides better designer support for Silverlight projects, such as:
    - A full-featured WYSIWYG editor that lets you drag and drop controls, set properties, create bindings, and preview animations.
    - A split view that shows both the XAML code and the design surface simultaneously.
    - A toolbox that contains all the Silverlight controls and components.
    - A property window that shows common, advanced, and attached properties of the selected element.
    - A data sources window that lets you create and manage data sources for your application.
4. **MFC-based GPU-accelerated graphics and animations**: MFC is a set of classes that simplify the development of Windows applications using C++. Visual Studio 2010 enables you to use MFC to create applications that leverage the power of the GPU (graphics processing unit) for rendering 2-D and 3-D graphics and animations. You can use the following technologies with MFC:
    - Direct2D: A hardware-accelerated, immediate-mode, 2-D graphics API that provides high performance and high-quality rendering for 2-D geometry, bitmaps, and text. [^4^]
    - DirectWrite: A hardware-accelerated, high-quality text layout and rendering API that supports international text, typography, and ClearType.
    - Windows Animation: A framework that simplifies creating rich and fluid animations using keyframes, transitions, easing functions, and timers.
5. **New AMD and Intel instruction set support**: Visual Studio 2010 supports new instruction sets from AMD and Intel that can improve the performance of your applications on modern processors. These include:
    - SSE4.1 and SSE4.2: Extensions to the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instruction set that provide new capabilities for media processing, string manipulation, cryptography, and hashing.
    - AES-NI: An extension to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) instruction set that accelerates encryption and decryption operations.
    - AVX: An extension to the x86 instruction set that provides new capabilities for floating-point operations, such as wider vectors, more registers, and better alignment.
