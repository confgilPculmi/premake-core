# How to Download and Use SetFSB 2.3 to Overclock Your CPU
 
SetFSB 2.3 is a program that allows you to overclock your CPU by adjusting the Front Side Bus (FSB) speed, which connects the CPU to the main memory. Overclocking can increase the performance of your computer, but it also involves some risks and requires advanced knowledge of hardware and software.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and use SetFSB 2.3 safely and effectively. Please note that this program is intended for experienced users only and may cause damage to your computer if used incorrectly. We are not responsible for any consequences of using this program.

## Step 1: Download SetFSB 2.3
 
You can download SetFSB 2.3 from Softpedia[^1^], a reputable website that offers free software downloads and reviews. The file size is about 238 KB and it is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. The program is a demo version that requires a license key to unlock all features.
 
To download SetFSB 2.3, click on the "Free Download" button on the Softpedia page and follow the instructions. You may need to disable your antivirus or firewall temporarily as some programs may flag SetFSB as a potential threat. This is a false positive and you can safely ignore it.
 
## Step 2: Select Your Clock Generator
 
After downloading SetFSB 2.3, extract the ZIP file and run the executable file. You will see a window with several options and sliders. The first thing you need to do is select your clock generator, which is the chip that controls the FSB speed on your motherboard.
 
To find out your clock generator model, you can use a program like CPU-Z or HWiNFO, or check your motherboard manual or website. Alternatively, you can try using the "Auto" option in SetFSB and see if it detects your clock generator automatically.
 
Once you have selected your clock generator, click on the "Get FSB" button to read the current FSB speed and other frequencies of your system. You should see four values: FSB (CPU), DDR (RAM), AGP (graphics card) and PCI (expansion cards).
 
## Step 3: Adjust Your FSB Speed
 
Now that you have read your current FSB speed, you can start overclocking by increasing it gradually using the slider or typing in a value. You should also adjust the other frequencies accordingly to maintain a stable ratio between them.
 
For example, if your original FSB speed is 200 MHz and your DDR speed is 400 MHz, you have a 1:2 ratio. If you increase your FSB speed to 220 MHz, you should also increase your DDR speed to 440 MHz to keep the same ratio.

The optimal ratio depends on your hardware configuration and preferences. Generally, higher FSB speeds result in higher CPU performance, while higher DDR speeds result in higher memory bandwidth. You may need to experiment with different ratios to find the best balance for your system.
 
## Step 4: Monitor Your System Parameters
 
As you overclock your CPU using SetFSB 2.3, you should monitor your system parameters such as temperature, voltage and frequency using other programs like HWMonitor or Core Temp. Overclocking can cause overheating, instability and damage to your hardware if done excessively or improperly.
 
You should also test your system stability using programs like Prime95 or OCCT that stress your CPU and RAM with intensive calculations. If your system crashes, freezes or shows errors during these tests, it means that your overclock is unstable and you need to lower your FSB speed or increase your voltage.
 
Voltage is another factor that affects overclocking performance and stability. Increasing voltage can help stabilize higher FSB speeds, but it also increases heat output and power consumption. SetFSB does not modify voltage values, so you need to use another program like BIOS or EasyTune to do that.
 
You should only increase voltage slightly and carefully, as too much voltage can damage your hardware permanently. You should also check the maximum
