BonCasClient is recommended for software that uses a smart card reader, such as TVTest, because it can decrypt scrambled signals more stably than BonCasProxy[^2^]. BonCasClient's bit size (32bit or 64bit) must match the software that uses it, otherwise the library loading will fail and the decryption will fail[^2^]. However, BonCasClient and BonCasLink can have different bit sizes because they communicate via TCP[^2^].
 
To use BonCasClient, you need to download the file from [here](http://www2.wazoku.net/2sen/dtvvup/source/BonCasClient%20%281.1.1%29.zip) and extract it to the same folder as the software that uses it. You also need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package for your bit size[^2^]. You can configure the connection destination by creating a BonCasClient.ini file in the same folder as the DLL, or by using the SetConfig function in the DLL[^1^].
 
BonCasLink is licensed under GPL, which means you can freely attach or incorporate it into your own software, but you must disclose the source code[^2^]. You are not allowed to modify the source code or the communication protocol[^2^]. For more details, please refer to the original Readme files in the zip file[^1^] [^2^].

## How to use BonCasServer to share a smart card reader over LAN
 
BonCasServer is a program that runs on the PC where the smart card reader is connected. It acts as a server that accepts requests from BonCasClient or BonCasProxy over TCP and forwards them to the smart card reader. It also sends back the responses from the smart card reader to the client[^1^].
 
To use BonCasServer, you need to download the file from [here](http://www2.wazoku.net/2sen/friioup/source/up1085.zip) and extract it to any folder. You also need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package for your bit size[^1^]. You can run BonCasServer.exe and configure the port number and other settings in the dialog box. You can also run BonCasService.exe as a Windows service that runs in the background[^1^].
 
BonCasServer is licensed under GPL, which means you can freely attach or incorporate it into your own software, but you must disclose the source code[^1^]. You are not allowed to modify the source code or the communication protocol[^1^]. For more details, please refer to the original Readme files in the zip file[^1^].
  
## How to use BonCasProxy to share a smart card reader over LAN
 
BonCasProxy is a program that runs on the PC where you want to use a smart card reader that is connected to another PC over LAN. It acts as a proxy that intercepts the WinSCard API calls from the application that uses the smart card reader and redirects them to BonCasLink's client implemented in BonCasStub.dll. It also receives the responses from BonCasLink's server and passes them back to the application[^1^].
 
To use BonCasProxy, you need to download the file from [here](http://www2.wazoku.net/2sen/friioup/source/up1085.zip) and extract it to any folder. You also need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package for your bit size[^1^]. You can run BonCasProxy.exe and configure the IP address and port number of BonCasLink's server in the dialog box. You can also click on the tray icon and select "Client Settings" from the menu[^1^].
 
BonCasProxy is licensed under GPL, which means you can freely attach or incorporate it into your own software, but you must disclose the source code[^1^]. You are not allowed to modify the source code or the communication protocol[^1^]. For more details, please refer to the original Readme files in the zip file[^1^].
