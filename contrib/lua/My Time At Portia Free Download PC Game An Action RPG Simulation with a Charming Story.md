If you want to get the most out of My Time At Portia, you might want to follow some tips and tricks that can help you improve your gameplay. Here are some of the best ones that I found online:
 
- Fix the gaps in your house as soon as possible. This will increase your stamina regeneration when you sleep, which means you can do more during the day. You will need 33 wood to fix all the holes in your floorboards. You can collect wood from sticks on the ground or chop down trees with a stone axe.
- Keep an eye on the economy. You can sell your extra items to merchants, but don't do it when the market price is below 100%. Wait for it to go up to 110% or higher to get more money for your goods. You can see the market price on the right side of the merchant's inventory.
- Purple dots in the Abandoned Ruins lead to Abandoned Rooms. These are special areas that contain rare relics, chests, and enemies. You can use your Relic Scanner to find them, but be prepared for a fight. Abandoned Rooms are usually guarded by powerful monsters that can drop valuable loot.
- Don't just build one furnace - build ten! You will need a lot of materials to craft items and complete commissions, and furnaces are essential for smelting ores and making bars. Having multiple furnaces running at the same time will speed up your production and save you time. You can also build multiple other crafting stations, such as grinders, cutters, skivers, and more.
- Rent a horse from McDonald. Horses are great for traveling around Portia faster and carrying more items. However, buying a stable and a horse can be expensive and take up a lot of space on your farm. A cheaper and easier option is to rent a horse from McDonald for 500 gols a week. You can also ride llamas if you catch and tame them.
- Use the feather duster to pet multiple animals. If you decide to raise animals on your farm, you will need to pet them every day to increase their happiness and productivity. Instead of petting them one by one, you can use the feather duster item to pet all the animals in an area with one click. This will save you time and energy.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that I learned while playing My Time At Portia. There are many more things to discover and enjoy in this game, so I hope you have fun exploring Portia and building your dream workshop!
