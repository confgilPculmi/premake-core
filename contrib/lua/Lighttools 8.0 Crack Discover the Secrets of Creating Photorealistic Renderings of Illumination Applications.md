## Multi-CPU Support for Faster Simulations
 
One of the most significant enhancements in LightTools 8.0 is the multi-CPU support that enables illumination simulation processes to take advantage of all CPUs or cores on your computer. This means that you can run simulations faster and more efficiently, reducing your design cycle time and cost.
 
According to Synopsys, the developer of LightTools, the multi-CPU feature can dramatically improve the speed of simulations, analyses and design optimizations[^2^]. For example, one user reported a more than 4X speed improvement for a simulation with 1.5 million rays[^2^]. This can make a huge difference when you need to perform multiple iterations or complex optimizations for your illumination design.
 
## New 3D Objects for Easier Design Creation
 
Another feature that can simplify your design process is the introduction of new types of 3D objects in LightTools 8.0. These include revolved sheets and solids, extruded sheets and solids and freeform sheets. These objects expand the range of shapes available for creating state-of-the-art illumination optics, such as compact, freeform surfaces used in automotive headlights[^2^].
 
You can easily create these objects by defining their profiles and parameters in LightTools' intuitive interface. You can also modify them using parametric controls or Boolean operations. These objects can help you design complex lighting components with less effort and more flexibility.
 
## Other Improvements and Enhancements
 
LightTools 8.0 also offers many other improvements and enhancements that can help you achieve better results for your illumination design. Some of these include:
 
- A SmartStart Library that provides access to a library of materials and media commonly used in optical systems[^1^]. This can save you time and reduce costs by eliminating the need to create or import these data manually.
- An interoperability with CODE V that allows you to import lens data from CODE V into LightTools for illumination analysis[^1^]. This can help you verify and optimize your optical system performance in both imaging and non-imaging domains.
- A street lighting utility that helps you design street lighting systems that meet specific standards and requirements[^1^]. You can define parameters such as pole height, spacing, tilt angle, road width and luminous intensity distribution, and LightTools will automatically generate a street lighting layout for you.
- An improved model data management that allows you to organize your model data into folders and subfolders[^1^]. You can also use filters and search tools to find and access your data easily.
- An expanded toolset for visualizing illuminance in lighting designs[^1^]. You can use color maps, false color images, contour plots, histograms and statistics to analyze and compare your illuminance results.

## Conclusion
 
LightTools 8.0 is a comprehensive solution for illumination design that offers many features and benefits that can enhance your productivity and performance. Whether you are designing automotive headlights, street lights, displays or any other illumination application, LightTools 8.0 can help you create illumination designs that work right the first try.
