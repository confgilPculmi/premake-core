The Indian Railway Medical Service (IRMS) is a cadre of doctors who serve the Indian Railways, one of the largest employers in the world. The IRMS doctors are responsible for providing health care to the railway employees, their families and passengers, as well as managing the railway hospitals and health units across the country.

The IRMS was established in 1929 as a separate organized service under the Ministry of Railways. The recruitment to IRMS is done through the Combined Medical Services Examination (CMSE) conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) every year. The candidates who qualify the CMSE are allocated to IRMS or other central health services based on their rank and preference.
 
The seniority list of IRMS officers is prepared by the Railway Board based on their date of appointment, date of birth and category. The seniority list determines the promotion, transfer and posting of the IRMS officers. The seniority list is updated periodically and published on the official website of the Ministry of Railways.
 
The latest seniority list of IRMS officers was published on February 23, 2023. It contains the names, categories, dates of birth, dates of appointment, dates of regularisation and railway zones of 283 IRMS officers. The seniority list can be accessed from [here](https://indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,530,1815).
