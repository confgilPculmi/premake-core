# Mach3 CNC Control Software: What You Need to Know
 
Mach3 is a popular CNC control software that allows you to turn your PC into a full-featured 6-axis CNC controller. It can control various types of machines, such as routers, mills, lathes, plasma cutters, and more. Mach3 works on most Windows PCs and supports parallel port and external motion devices.
 
However, Mach3 is not a free software. You need to purchase a license from Artsoft, the official vendor of Mach3, to unlock its full potential. A license costs $175 and can be used on up to 5 machines. You can also download a demo version of Mach3 that has some limitations, such as a 500-line gcode limit and no spindle speed control.

Some people may try to find a cracked version of Mach3 that bypasses the license verification and allows them to use the software for free. However, this is not recommended for several reasons. First of all, using a cracked version of Mach3 is illegal and unethical. You are violating the intellectual property rights of Artsoft and depriving them of their deserved income. Secondly, using a cracked version of Mach3 may compromise the safety and performance of your CNC machine. You may encounter bugs, errors, viruses, or malware that can damage your PC or your machine. Thirdly, using a cracked version of Mach3 may prevent you from getting updates, support, or warranty from Artsoft. You may miss out on new features, bug fixes, or technical assistance that can improve your CNC experience.
 
Therefore, if you want to use Mach3 CNC control software, you should buy a legitimate license from Artsoft or one of their authorized resellers. This way, you can enjoy the full benefits of Mach3 and support the development of this amazing software.
  
How to Use Mach3 CNC Software
 
If you have installed Mach3 and configured it for your CNC machine, you may wonder how to use it to control your machine. In this section, we will cover some of the basic features and functions of Mach3 that you need to know to start machining.
 
## Loading and Running a G-Code Program
 
One of the main tasks of Mach3 is to load and run a G-Code program that contains the instructions for your CNC machine. To load a G-Code program, you can either use the File menu or the Load GCode button on the main screen. You can then browse your computer and select the file you want to load. Mach3 will display the program in the G-Code window and show a graphical preview of the toolpath in the Toolpath window.
 
To run a G-Code program, you need to first make sure that your machine is properly homed and zeroed. Homing is the process of moving the machine to its reference position, usually by using limit switches or home switches. Zeroing is the process of setting the work coordinate system (WCS) for your part, usually by using a touch probe or an edge finder. You can use the buttons on the main screen or the keyboard shortcuts to jog your machine to the desired position and set the zero point.
 
Once your machine is ready, you can press the Cycle Start button or hit Alt-R on your keyboard to start running the program. Mach3 will execute each line of code and move your machine accordingly. You can monitor the progress of your program by looking at the DROs (digital readouts) that show the current position, feed rate, spindle speed, and other information. You can also use the Feed Hold button or hit Spacebar on your keyboard to pause the program if you need to make adjustments or check something. To resume the program, press Cycle Start again.

## Using Wizards and LazyCam
 
Mach3 also provides some tools to help you create or modify G-Code programs without using a separate CAM software. These tools are called Wizards and LazyCam. Wizards are mini-programs that allow you to perform common operations, such as drilling holes, cutting slots, engraving text, etc. LazyCam is a program that allows you to import DXF, BMP, JPG, and HPGL files and convert them into G-Code.
 
To access Wizards, you can either use the Wizards menu or click on the Newfangled Solutions logo on the main screen. You will see a list of available wizards that you can choose from. Each wizard has its own interface and parameters that you need to fill in. Once you are done, you can either save the generated G-Code as a file or load it directly into Mach3.
 
To access LazyCam, you can either use the File menu or click on the LazyCam icon on the main screen. You will see a separate window where you can open an image file and edit it. You can use various tools to crop, rotate, scale, mirror, offset, or simplify your image. You can also create layers and assign different machining operations to each layer. Once you are done, you can either save the generated G-Code as a file or load it directly into Mach3.
 
## Customizing Mach3
 
One of the advantages of Mach3 is that it is highly customizable. You can change various settings and options to suit your preferences and needs. You can also create your own interface and macros using VBScript.
 
To access the configuration settings, you can either use the Config menu or click on the Config button on the main screen. You will see a list of categories that you can choose from, such as Ports & Pins, Motor Tuning, General Config, etc. Each category has its own dialog box where you can adjust various parameters related to your hardware and software setup. You should consult the Mach3 manual or online resources for more details on each setting.
 
To create your own interface, you need to use a program called Screen4 or MachScreen. These programs allow you to design your own screensets using various elements, such as buttons, DROs, LEDs, etc. You can also assign scripts or functions to each element using VBScript. You should consult the Screen4 or MachScreen manual or online resources for more details on how to use these programs.
