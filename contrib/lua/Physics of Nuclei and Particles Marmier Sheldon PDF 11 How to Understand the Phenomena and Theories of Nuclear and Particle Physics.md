One of the classic textbooks on this subject is **Physics of Nuclei and Particles** by Pierre Marmier and Eric Sheldon[^2^], first published in 1970. This two-volume book provides a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to the theoretical and experimental aspects of nuclear and particle physics. It covers topics such as nuclear structure, nuclear spectroscopy, nuclear models, nuclear reactions, scattering theory, reaction mechanisms, fission and fusion, beta decay, gamma decay, neutrino physics, mesons and baryons, quarks and gluons, symmetries and conservation laws, weak interactions, electromagnetic interactions and strong interactions.
 
The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students who have a solid background in quantum mechanics and classical electrodynamics. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and professionals who work in the fields of nuclear and particle physics. The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous examples, exercises and problems. It also includes appendices on mathematical methods, physical constants and units.

The latest edition of the book is the 11th edition[^1^], which was published in 2020 by Elsevier. It has been updated and revised to reflect the latest developments and discoveries in the field. It also features new chapters on neutrino oscillations, neutrinoless double beta decay, dark matter and dark energy. The book is available in both print and ebook formats.

Physics of nuclei and particles is a fascinating and challenging field that aims to understand the fundamental nature of matter and energy. It has many applications in science, technology and society, such as nuclear power, nuclear medicine, nuclear weapons, particle accelerators, particle detectors, astrophysics and cosmology.
 
Some of the open questions and unsolved problems in this field are: What is the origin of the mass of the proton and the neutron? What is the structure of the neutron star and the black hole? What are the properties of the quark-gluon plasma? What is the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? What is the ultimate theory of everything that unifies all the forces and particles?
 
To answer these questions and explore new phenomena, physicists use various experimental and theoretical methods. They design and build powerful particle accelerators that smash nuclei and particles at high energies and create new forms of matter. They also use sophisticated particle detectors that measure and analyze the products of these collisions. They also use advanced mathematical tools and computational techniques to develop and test various models and theories that describe the physics of nuclei and particles.
