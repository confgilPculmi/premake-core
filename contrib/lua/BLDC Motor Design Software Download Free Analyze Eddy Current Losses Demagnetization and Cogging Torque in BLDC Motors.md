Brushless DC (BLDC) motors are widely used in applications that require high efficiency, reliability and low maintenance. They are also suitable for variable speed and torque control. However, designing and analyzing BLDC motors can be challenging, especially if you don't have access to expensive commercial software. Fortunately, there are some free software tools that can help you with this task. In this article, we will introduce three of them and show you how to use them.
  
## MotorAnalysis
 
MotorAnalysis is a free electric machine design software that supports induction motors and generators, permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) and generators and BLDC machines. It is based on automated finite element analysis (FEA) simulations and establishes a complete set of tools for design and analysis of electric motors and generators. You can download it from [https://motoranalysis.com/](https://motoranalysis.com/).

To use MotorAnalysis, you need to select a template for your motor type and customize the dimensions and parameters according to your specifications. You can also edit the winding configuration and the material properties. Then, you can run the analysis and get the results for the performance characteristics, such as torque, speed, power, efficiency, losses, flux density, current density, etc. You can also compare different designs and optimize your motor.
  
## MotorWizard
 
MotorWizard is a template-based motor design software that is integrated inside SOLIDWORKS. It allows SOLIDWORKS users to build and analyze different electric machine designs, including BLDC motors. You can request a trial from [https://www.emworks.com/product/MotorWizard](https://www.emworks.com/product/MotorWizard).
 
To use MotorWizard, you need to select a template for your motor type and customize the dimensions and parameters according to your specifications. You can also edit the winding configuration and the material properties. Then, you can run the analysis and get the results for the performance characteristics, such as torque, speed, power, efficiency, losses, flux density, current density, etc. You can also compare different designs and optimize your motor.
  
## BLDC
 
BLDC is a comprehensive brushless DC design tool that includes analysis of both the drive circuit and the electric machine itself. It is carried out simultaneously and entirely within BLDC. You can download it from [https://www.magneforcess.com/bldc/](https://www.magneforcess.com/bldc/).
 
To use BLDC, you need to specify the input voltage, current and frequency of your drive circuit and select a topology for your motor type. You can also edit the dimensions and parameters of your motor according to your specifications. Then, you can run the analysis and get the results for the performance characteristics, such as torque, speed, power, efficiency, losses, flux density, current density, etc. You can also compare different designs and optimize your motor.
  
### Conclusion
 
In this article, we have introduced three free software tools that can help you design and analyze BLDC motors: MotorAnalysis, MotorWizard and BLDC. They are easy to use and provide accurate results for the electric machine performance. You can use them to create your own BLDC motor designs or improve existing ones.
