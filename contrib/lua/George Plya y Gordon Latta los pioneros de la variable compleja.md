# Variable Compleja: A Classic Textbook by George PÃ³lya and Gordon Latta
 
Variable Compleja (Complex Variables) is a textbook written by George PÃ³lya and Gordon Latta, two renowned mathematicians and educators. The book was first published in English in 1974 by Wiley, and later translated into Spanish by Limusa in 1976. It covers the basic theory and applications of complex analysis, a branch of mathematics that studies functions of complex numbers.
 
The book is divided into 11 chapters, each with a number of exercises and problems. The chapters are:

Complex analysis is not only a fascinating and elegant branch of mathematics, but also a powerful tool for solving many problems in science and engineering. Some of the applications of complex analysis are:
 
Complex analysis - a branch of mathematics that studies complex functions and their properties[^1^] [^2^].,  Complex numbers - numbers that can be written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit[^1^] [^2^].,  Complex plane - a two-dimensional plane where complex numbers can be represented as points with coordinates (a,b)[^1^] [^2^].,  Complex function - a function that maps complex numbers to complex numbers[^1^] [^2^].,  Analytic function - a complex function that is differentiable at every point in its domain[^1^] [^2^].,  Cauchy-Riemann equations - a set of partial differential equations that characterize analytic functions[^1^] [^2^].,  Conformal mapping - a transformation that preserves angles between curves in the complex plane[^1^] [^2^].,  Harmonic function - a real-valued function that satisfies Laplace's equation[^1^] [^2^].,  Contour integration - a method of evaluating integrals along curves in the complex plane[^1^] [^2^].,  Cauchy's integral theorem - a theorem that states that the integral of an analytic function along a closed curve is zero[^1^] [^2^].,  Cauchy's integral formula - a formula that relates the value of an analytic function at a point to its values along a circle around that point[^1^] [^2^].,  Residue theorem - a theorem that allows the evaluation of complex integrals using residues, which are the coefficients of the Laurent series expansion of an analytic function around a singularity[^1^] [^2^].,  Laurent series - a series expansion of an analytic function in terms of powers of z-z0, where z0 is a point in the complex plane[^1^] [^2^].,  Singularity - a point where an analytic function is not defined or not differentiable[^1^] [^2^].,  Pole - a singularity where an analytic function behaves like 1/(z-z0)^n for some positive integer n[^1^] [^2^].,  Essential singularity - a singularity where an analytic function has no Laurent series expansion[^1^] [^2^].,  Removable singularity - a singularity where an analytic function can be extended to be analytic by defining its value at that point[^1

- Signal processing: Complex analysis and Fourier analysis go hand in hand in the analysis of signals, such as sound, light, radio waves, etc. Complex numbers can be used to represent the amplitude and phase of a signal, and complex functions can be used to transform, filter, compress, decompress, encrypt, decrypt, and manipulate signals in various ways. For example, complex analysis can be used to analyse sound waves in speech recognition[^3^].
- Control theory: Complex analysis can be used to design and analyse feedback systems that regulate the behaviour of a dynamic system, such as a robot, a vehicle, a chemical reactor, etc. Complex numbers can be used to represent the poles and zeros of a transfer function, which determine the stability and performance of a system. Complex functions can be used to model the frequency response and the root locus of a system.
- Fluid dynamics: Complex analysis can be used to study the flow of fluids, such as air, water, oil, etc. Complex numbers can be used to represent the velocity potential and the stream function of a fluid, and complex functions can be used to map the flow from one domain to another. For example, complex analysis can be used to find the lift and drag forces on an airfoil.
- Electromagnetism: Complex analysis can be used to study the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, such as voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, inductance, etc. Complex numbers can be used to represent the phasors of alternating currents and voltages, and complex functions can be used to solve Laplace's equation and Maxwell's equations. For example, complex analysis can be used to find the impedance and admittance of an electric circuit.
- Quantum mechanics: Complex analysis can be used to study the nature of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. Complex numbers can be used to represent the wave function and the probability amplitude of a quantum system, and complex functions can be used to solve SchrÃ¶dinger's equation and Dirac's equation. For example, complex analysis can be used to find the energy levels and eigenstates of a quantum system.

These are just some of the many applications of complex analysis in various fields. As you can see, complex analysis is not only a beautiful mathematical theory, but also a practical and useful tool for solving real-world problems.
