Space Engineers is a sandbox game that lets you build and explore space ships, stations, and planets. You can create anything from small fighters to massive carriers, and use them to mine resources, fight enemies, or just have fun. But what if you don't want to pay for the game? Is there a way to download and play Space Engineers for free with online multiplayer?

The answer is yes, but you need to be careful. There are many websites that claim to offer free downloads of Space Engineers, but some of them are scams that can infect your computer with malware or steal your personal information. Others may provide outdated or incomplete versions of the game that won't work properly or have limited features. And even if you find a legitimate download link, you may still face problems with connecting to online servers or playing with your friends.
 
That's why we recommend using a trusted source like Nexus-Games[^1^] or Game3rb[^2^] to download Space Engineers for free. These websites provide the latest version of the game with all DLCs and updates, as well as a Steamwork fix that allows you to play online with other players who have the same crack. You don't need to install anything, just extract the game files and run the launcher as administrator. You can also join their Discord servers for support and feedback.
 
To play online, you need to have Steam installed and logged in to your profile. You also need to have Spacewar[^4^], a free game that is used as a base for many cracked games. You can install it by typing `steam://install/480` in your browser or Windows Run dialog. Then, you can either accept an invitation from a friend who has the same crack, or create your own server by choosing New Game > My own game > Friends online mode > Open. You can then invite your friends from the Esc menu.

If you are new to Space Engineers, you may wonder what you can do in the game and how to get started. Here are some tips and tricks to help you out:
 
- The game has two modes: creative and survival. In creative mode, you have unlimited resources and can build anything you want without any restrictions. In survival mode, you have to gather resources, craft components, manage your energy and oxygen, and deal with threats like meteor showers, pirates, or hostile players.
- You can choose from different scenarios or worlds to play in, or create your own custom world with various settings and mods. You can also download and subscribe to workshop items from other players, such as ships, stations, planets, scripts, or skins.
- You can control your character with the WASD keys and the mouse. You can also use the jetpack to fly around with the spacebar and shift keys. To interact with objects, use the F key or the middle mouse button. To access your inventory, press I or G. To access the terminal of a ship or station, press K or T.
- You can build anything you want with blocks and tools. To access the building menu, press G or B. You can select different blocks from the categories on the left, or search for them by name. You can also drag and drop blocks to your toolbar for quick access. To place a block, use the left mouse button. To remove a block, use the right mouse button.
- You can also use tools to perform various actions. The welder is used to construct blocks from components. The grinder is used to deconstruct blocks and get components back. The drill is used to mine ores from asteroids or planets. The handbrake is used to lock your wheels on a vehicle.
- You can also use weapons to defend yourself or attack others. The rifle is a basic firearm that shoots bullets. The rocket launcher is a powerful weapon that fires explosive rockets. The precision rifle is a sniper weapon that has a scope and a silencer. The welder and grinder can also be used as melee weapons.

Space Engineers is a game that offers endless possibilities and challenges for your creativity and engineering skills. Whether you want to build a simple rover or a complex space station, explore the solar system or fight in epic battles, you can do it all in Space Engineers. And with online multiplayer, you can share your creations and adventures with other players around the world.
