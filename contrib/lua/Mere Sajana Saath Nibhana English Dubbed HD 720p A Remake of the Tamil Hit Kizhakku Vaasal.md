# Mere Sajana Saath Nibhana: A Bollywood Classic with a Twist
 
Mere Sajana Saath Nibhana is a 1992 Bollywood Indian film directed by Zebadiah Shah and starring Asha Parekh in a dual role. The film is a remake of the 1966 Hindi film Mera Saaya, which was itself based on the 1960 Marathi film Pathlaag. The film tells the story of a lawyer named Ravi (Mithun Chakraborty) who is accused of murdering his wife Meera (Asha Parekh), who had gone missing after a car accident. However, he is shocked when a woman claiming to be Meera appears in court and testifies against him. The woman is actually Meera's lookalike Geeta (also Asha Parekh), who has been hired by Ravi's enemies to frame him. Ravi has to prove his innocence and find out the truth about his wife's fate.

The film also faced some competition from other Bollywood releases in 1992, such as Deewana, Khuda Gawah, Beta and Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar. The film could not match the success of these films and was overshadowed by them at the box office. The film also failed to impress the overseas audience and did not have a significant collection in the international markets.
 
Mere Sajana Saath Nibhana is a film that has its own merits and demerits, but it is not a film that can be easily forgotten.
